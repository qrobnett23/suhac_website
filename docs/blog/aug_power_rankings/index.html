<p>The NHL season is right around the corner. So, why not rank teams based on where they stand? This ranking is bound to look awful by mid-November. It’s impossible to know how these teams will look on the ice until we see it. But, it’s fun to speculate. So, here is my August edition of the Power Rankings!</p>
<section id="cup-contenders" class="level1">
<h1>Cup Contenders</h1>
<p>These teams are the cream of the crop. I expect these teams to be in the playoffs and to be competing for the Stanley Cup.</p>
<section id="vegas-golden-knights" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="vegas-golden-knights">1. Vegas Golden Knights</h4>
<p><strong><em>Key Additions:</em></strong> None<br>
<strong><em>Key Departures:</em></strong> Laurent Brossoit, Teddy Blueger, Reilly Smith<br>
<strong><em>Stanley Cup Odds (DraftKings):</em></strong> +1200</p>
<p>I feel obligated to have the champs on top. They’re the champs. Until we see teams in action, there’s no need to speculate about who deserves the number one spot.</p>
<p>Vegas will try to run it back on the back of a strong lineup top to bottom. It starts with Jack Eichel, who had a great playoffs. I expect him to return to being a superstar this year. Last year, he had 66 points in 67 games following his injury. I could see him eclipsing 100 if he plays the full season. The rest of the forward core remains deep, even after trading away an original Golden Misfit, Reilly Smith. Mark Stone continues to be a two-way star when healthy, Conn Smythe Trophy winner Jonathan Marchessault should continue putting up solid numbers, and they re-signed Ivan Barbashev who was outstanding for them in their run.</p>
<p>The defense is also incredible, one through six. They will continue to be incredibly tough to play against. The only minor question is in net. Adin Hill did have a spectacular playoff run. With Brossoit out the door, it’s his job for now. He’s never had more than 27 starts in a season. How will he hold up?</p>
<p>Ultimately, this team is poised to make another run. The Pacific division will be tougher than in years past, but they should have no problem securing a top three spot.</p>
</section>
<section id="carolina-hurricanes" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="carolina-hurricanes">2. Carolina Hurricanes</h4>
<p><strong><em>Key Additions:</em></strong> Dmitry Orlov, Tony DeAngelo, Caleb Jones, Michael Bunting<br>
<strong><em>Key Departures:</em></strong> Max Pacioretty, Shayne Gostisbehere<br>
<strong><em>Stanley Cup Odds (DraftKings):</em></strong> +800</p>
<p>Looking at the Hurricanes’ roster makes me wonder if the Golden Knights are actually as deep as I claimed. The Hurricanes took a deep roster and made it deeper with many offseason additions. They have eight, yes eight, NHL caliber defenseman on thier roster. Jaccob Slavin, Brent Burns, Brett Pesce, Brady Skjei, and Jalen Chatfield return from last season. Already a great unit. So the Hurricanes decide to add Dmitry Orlov, Tony DeAngelo, and Caleb Jones! That’s ridiculous! It will be intersting to see who gets ice time early on, but there’s no doubt that the Hurricanes have the most defensive depth in the league.</p>
<p>The forward group is also very deep. They lost Max Pacioretty, but did they ever really have him? So they went out and got Michael Bunting who will help bolster the Hurricanes top six. Now while they are deep, the biggest question for the Hurricanes is will they be able to find elite top-level scoring? This seems to be the struggle every year. You may think, “Well, they have Sebastian Aho”. There’s no denying that Aho is an elite play driver. However is career high in points (I was shocked when I looked this up) is only 83. He’s been right around a point per game for the last six seasons. It feels like he should be able to take the next step. Or maybe not. Maybe this is who he is, or maybe it’s the system. If the Canes want to go far, he needs to be “<em>the</em> guy”. Who else is going to be “<em>the</em> guy”? Andrei Svechnikov has superstar potential and is only 23, but I wouldn’t expect a big jump from him coming off an ACL tear. Young guys like Seth Jarvis and Jesperi Kotkaniemi could make a leap, but would it be enough? So while they are deep, they are just that, deep. I expect their games to one again be a defensive slog.</p>
<p>As far as goaltending, they seem to be running it back with Frederik Andersen and Antti Raanta with Pyotr Kochetkov waiting in the wings for when one (or both) of them get injured. I’m not too worried about the goaltending for the regular season. The Hurricanes system should be able to make any goaltender look good (just ask David Ayres). Can Andersen and Raanta be healthy for a playoff run is the real concern. Or will Kochetkov take the starting job? Barring a disaster, the Hurricanes will once again be in position to make a run. Can they finally get over the hump and win an Eastern Conference Final game (and maybe the Cup too)?</p>
</section>
<section id="dallas-stars" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dallas-stars">3. Dallas Stars</h4>
<p><strong><em>Key Additions:</em></strong> Matt Duchene<br>
<strong><em>Key Departures:</em></strong> Colin Miller, Max Domi, Luke Glendening<br>
<strong><em>Stanley Cup Odds (DraftKings):</em></strong> +1400</p>
<p>After being beat out by one point for the Central division title last year, I believe this is the year that Stars take that title. As a whole, the Central Division is weaker than in years past. The Predators and Blues have entered retools and the Wild didn’t improve during the offseason. I view this as a two horse race, and the Avalanche have many new pieces that could take time to gel. The Stars are a young team coming off a Western Conference Final appearance. By my measure, they’re the team to beat in the Central.</p>
<p>The Stars’ top line has an argument for the best in the league. First of all, they’ve found a superstar in Jason Robertson. I believe he can put up an MVP-caliber season. Of course, Connor McDavid will likely win it, but I can’t even find odds for Robertson to win the award, which seems crazy given that he just put up 109 points. Next up is the man who seems to get better with age, Joe Pavelski. After setting a new career high in points in 2021-22 with 81, he followed it up with 77. On top of that, he continues to be a defensive menace. To round it out, they’ve got another emerging superstar in Roope Hintz. Those in the analytics community have known about Hintz for some time, and the past two seasons he’s made a name for himself in the league. Alongside Robertson and Pavelski, I believe he can have a 90+ point season.</p>
<p>Past the first line, they’ve got some intriguing players. Wyatt Johnston is coming off an incredible rookie season. They signed Matt Duchene who should help round out the middle six. Tyler Seguin and Jamie Benn are aging, but could still provide some value. The defensive unit is also intriguing. They are led by a two-way star in Miro Heiskanen, who should once again be in the Norris Trophy conversation.</p>
<p>And, of course, they have a proven goalie. Jake Oettinger followed up an incredible playoff performance in 2022 with a great year, finishing 5th in Vezina voting. He did struggle in this years playoffs, but was good enough to get them nine wins. If the Stars can get him playing like he was in the Flames series for a whole playoff run, they could very well be unbeatable.</p>
</section>
<section id="colorado-avalanche" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="colorado-avalanche">4. Colorado Avalanche</h4>
<p><strong><em>Key Additions:</em></strong> Ryan Johansen, Ross Colton, Jonathan Drouin, Miles Wood<br>
<strong><em>Key Departures:</em></strong> JT Compher, Alex Newhook, Darren Helm, Evan Rodrigues, Lars Eller, Erik Johnson<br>
<strong><em>Stanley Cup Odds (DraftKings):</em></strong> +1000</p>
<p>The 2021-22 Avalanche were one of the best teams in the salary cap era. After amassing 119 points in the regular season, they rolled through the playoffs, winning thhe cup with a 16-4 record and never trailing in a series. Last season was a different story. First of all, they lost a lot of scoring and depth to free agency, the most notable being Nazem Kadri and Andre Burakovsky. On top of that, they could never stay healthy. Captain Gabriel Landeskog missed the entire season with a knee injury, and most everyone else was in and out of the lineup. Nothing could go right.</p>
<p>Even after a disappointing season, the Avs’ window is still wide open, and they should remain one of the best teams in the league. There’s no denying their core is one of the best in the league, if not the best. Nathan MacKinnon, Cale Makar, and Mikko Rantanen are all superstars. Makar’s defensive partner, Devon Toews, is a two-way savant. Valeri Nichushkin and Artturi Lehkonen are incredible forechecking wingers. Through all of the challenges they faced last season, this core was still able to win the Central division and take the feisty Kraken to 7 games.</p>
<p>The question for the Avs is if they can get secondary production. With even more forwards leaving in free agency, and Landeskog slated to miss <em>another</em> year, GM Chris MacFarland brought in some new names that they’re hoping can fill the void and give the big guys some much needed help. Ryan Johansen comes over from the Predators and will likely be the second line center. Can he have a bounce back year on a new team? They brought in Ross Colton and Miles Wood to add speed and tenacity to the bottom six. Lastly, they signed Jonathan Drouin, who will reunite with former Halifax Mooseheads teammate Nathan MacKinnon. Can MacKinnon reignite Drouin?</p>
<p>The defense and goaltending remain largely the same. Barring injuries (to either himself or defenders), I would expect another solid year for Alexandar Georgiev. The Avs have proven that goalies can thrive behind their system. Ultimately, there are some questions with scoring depth, but the Avs have all the pieces to get a second cup with this core.</p>
</section>
<section id="new-jersey-devils" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="new-jersey-devils">5. New Jersey Devils</h4>
<p><strong><em>Key Additions:</em></strong> Tomas Nosek, Tyler Toffoli, Cal Foote, Colin Miller<br>
<strong><em>Key Departures:</em></strong> Ryan Graves, Miles Wood, Mackenzie Blackwood, Damon Severson, Yegor Sharangovich<br>
<strong><em>Stanley Cup Odds (DraftKings):</em></strong> +900</p>
<p>Last season was a disaster. The Devils came into the season with expectations of making the playoffs for the first time since 2018. However, they just couldn’t put it together. Nothing seemed to go right and chants of “Fire Lindy” rained down from appalled fans. Well, that is, for all of two games (yes, Devils fans were actually chanting this after two games).</p>
<p>After this disastrous, horrendous, unforgivable start, the Devils won 21 of their next 24 games and finished the season with the most points in franchise history. Not too shabby, Lindy (fans made it up to him by chanting “Sorry Lindy”). The truth is, the Devils were truly unstoppable for a good part of the year. They were a well-oiled, play controlling machine. They finished the year with the second best expected goals share (Moneypuck.com) bested by only the Hurricanes, the team they would eventually fall to in the second round.</p>
<p>The plethora of young star power on this team is astounding. Jack Hughes is on the brink of super stardom, falling one point shy of 100 last season. He’s only 22, and should continue to rise the ranks of the leagues best. Nico Hischier may just be the most underrated player in the league. This Swiss army knife does just about everything at an elite level, and with Patrice Bergeron retired, he should be a leading candidate for the Selke Trophy. Add to them Jesper Bratt, Dawson Mercer, Timo Meier, and newly acquired Tyler Toffoli, this unit looks devilishly good.</p>
<p>The defense should hold it’s own as well. They are led by Dougie Hamilton and Jonas Siegenthaler. Damon Severson and Ryan Graves are gone, but filling in is Jack’s brother, Luke Hughes. Luke showed flashes of brilliance in the few games he played last season. Take away overwhelming favorite Connor Bedard and Luke Hughes would be the Calder Trophy favorite (Bedard: -140, Hughes: +550). The goaltending is a question mark, but Akira Schmid looked like he could hold his own.</p>
<p>The Eastern Conference and the Metro division are stacked once again, but I’m confident the Devils will be near the top of the standings when all is said and done. Their window is all the way open and they’ll be contenders for years to come.</p>
</section>
<section id="edmonton-oilers" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="edmonton-oilers">6. Edmonton Oilers</h4>
<p><strong><em>Key Additions:</em></strong> Connor Brown<br>
<strong><em>Key Departures:</em></strong> Nick Bjugstad, Kailer Yamamoto, Klim Kostin<br>
<strong><em>Stanley Cup Odds (DraftKings):</em></strong> +1000</p>
<p>Is this the year Connor McDavid finally gets his Cup? It feels like we’ve been asking this question for a few years now. Although the past two years have ended in defeat, the Oilers have been right in the thick of it, losing to eventual Cup champs in both seasons. Maybe this year will end differently.</p>
<p>The Oilers will have no problem scoring. Connor McDavid is unquestionably the best player in the league. Last season, he put up a monstrous 153 points, numbers we haven’t seen since the 90’s. His running mate, Leon Draisaitl was no slouch himself putting up 128 points. With those two weapons, the Oilers were scoring at will. This is especially true for the power play, which was the best in league history. Even in the playoffs, the power play was clipping along at, <em>*checks notes*</em>, 46.1 percent!</p>
<p>With this scoring attack, the Oilers should be in line to make the playoffs yet again. However, how far can their defense and goaltending take them? Team defense for the Oilers has been a problem over the past few years. Adding Mattias Ekholm at the deadline certainly helped, but is that enough? With a weak free agency class, they did nothing to address their d-core in the offseason. They might look to the trade deadline once again if things aren’t looking good. And there are still questions in net. Jack Campbell is looking to bounce back after a horrendous year. Although rookie Stuart Skinner had a solid regular season earning him a Calder Trophy nomination, he struggled in the playoffs. Can either of them assert themselves as the number one option? The Oilers’ season could depend on it.</p>
</section>
<section id="toronto-maple-leafs" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="toronto-maple-leafs">7. Toronto Maple Leafs</h4>
<p><strong><em>Key Additions:</em></strong> Tyler Bertuzzi, John Klingberg, Max Domi, Ryan Reaves, Martin Jones<br>
<strong><em>Key Departures:</em></strong> Ryan O’Reilly, Luke Schenn, Alexander Kerfoot , Michael Bunting, Noel Acciari, Erik Gustafsson<br>
<strong><em>Stanley Cup Odds (DraftKings):</em></strong> +900</p>
<p>They did it! They finally did it! They won a round! Not only did they win a round, they avenged their loss from the previous season! They beat the Tampa Bay Lightning, who had been to three straight Stanley Cup Finals! Now they get a chance to avenge even more demons by beating the Boston Bruins in the second round….wait, what? Boston blew a 3-1 lead? Now they get to face a team that barely made the playoffs! This is it! This is the year! This year is different!</p>
<p>As it turned out, that team that barely made the playoffs turned out to get as hot as the sun and disposed of the Leafs in 5 games. It was a quick and disappointing exit for the Leafs after such a historical moment in the round previous. Now, they’ve once again got to pick up the pieces and evaluate if they really are a Stanley Cup contender. After a disagreement in the front office, GM Kyle Dubas is out the door. It is now up to Brad Treliving to find away to help this team get over the hump.</p>
<p>This team has all the talent to be a contender. They’ve shown it in the regular season for years now. Last year, they finally proved they could win in the playoffs. Sure, it was only one round. But they now know they can win. For the Leafs, it starts up front with two elite talents in Auston Matthews and Mitch Marner. Matthews had a “down” year last year, scoring “only” 40 goals in 74 games played. He should bounce back this year, and could once again eclipse 60. Marner is an elite play maker, but struggles in the playoffs. Well, he did. Last season, he finally put together a solid playoff performance. They ended up holding on to William Nylander who will once again play alongside John Tavares. And then, in the offseason, they added Tyler Bertuzzi and Max Domi. That’s an impressive top six. Rookie Matthew Knies could also slot in to the top six after playing an important role in the playoffs. If he does see significant time in the top six, Knies could garner a lot of Calder attention.</p>
<p>The defense isn’t going to knock anyone’s socks off, but they have some good pieces. Morgan Rielly is a strictly offensive defenseman and he plays his role very well. They also brought in John Klingberg, who provides even less defensive resitance but should help the second unit power play. As far as shutdown guys, they have TJ Brodie, Jake McCabe, and veteran Mark Giordano. Overall, it’s a solid d-core.</p>
<p>Of course, as with many teams, the goaltending is a question mark. However, it should be good enough to get them into the playoffs as a top three Atlantic team. And, the 2021-22 Avalanche proved that you don’t necessarily need the best goaltending to win the Cup if you’re good enough. Are they good enough?</p>

<strong><em>Stanley Cup Odds (DraftKings):</em></strong> +1300</p>
<p>The Rangers sneak into the Cup Contenders category for one reason and one reason alone: Igor Shesterkin. If you’re a good team with a goaltender as consistently great as Shesterkin, I believe that makes you a contender. And that is what I believe the Rangers are. A good team. I just don’t know if they’re a great team yet.</p>
<p>They did make an impressive run to the Eastern Conference Final in 2022, and had another good season this year, falling to the young and emerging Devils in seven games. They have top end talent in Artemi Panarin, Mika Zibanejad, and Adam Fox. Chris Kreider, even at age 32, remains a very good goal scorer.</p>
<p>I believe the key for this team to jump from good to great is the progression of their young talent. Kaapo Kakko, Filip Chytil, and Alexis Lafreniere need to all continue to take strides. All three have shown flashes. Can any of them find their footing and produce in a top six role? Or will they once again be stuck in third line minutes? Another guy who could take a big step is K’Andre Miller. He’s only 23 and had a good season last year. If he continues his upward trend, him and Fox could be one of the better defensive duos in the league.</p>
<p>Even with these questions, the Rangers have the potential to go far on the back of Shesterkin. If the kids figure it out, they could be truly dnagerous. Until then, they are a very good team and should be back in the Playoffs come April.</p>

<strong><em>Stanley Cup Odds (DraftKings):</em></strong> +1600</p>
<p>Quiz time! Who had more points last season: the Florida Panthers or the Calgary Flames? The correct answer is….. <em>drumroll</em> ….the Calgary Flames! And yet, their season will forever be viewed as a disappointment and the Panthers’ will be seen as a success. The truth is, the Panthers couldn’t quite put it together for the majority of the season. They couldn’t find a rhythm and string together wins. They had a lot of new players and a new coach. Well, they eventually put the pieces together, and just at the right time. After squeaking into the last playoff spot in the East and falling down 3-1 in the first round, they proceeded to win 11 of 12 on their way to the Stanley Cup Final.</p>
<p>They got to the final on the backs of two men: Matthew Tkachuk and Sergei Bobrovsky. The Panthers knew who they were getting when they traded for Tkachuk (and paid a steep price). He is incredible. Many analytics gurus call him a unicorn. he truly is one of a kind. No one else brings the two-way prowess like he does, as well as the intensity and grittiness. Fans of other teams hate the guy, for good reason. And then there’s the ten million dollar man, Sergei Bobrovsky. Bobrovsky has, in general, been a let down in his time with the Panthers, having only one season with a save percentage above .906. But in the playoffs, he took his game to levels we hadn’t seen since his Columbus days. I will always wonder who would have won the Conn Smythe had they won the Cup. It likely would have been Tkachuk given his repeated clutch goals, but take either of those guys away and they don’t come close to the Final. They relied on both of them.</p>
<p>I believe this will still need to be the case. They need to rely on those two guys. I have no qualms about Tkachuk to continue dominating, but can Bobrovsky put together a good season? The Panthers will be lacking defensive depth to start the season with both Aaron Ekblad and Brandon Montour recovering from injuries sustained during their run. So, they will need Bobrovsky to step up.</p>
<p>Heading into their second year under head coach Paul Maurice, I expect the Panthers to find a groove a bit earlier this season. They have plenty of talent up front. Once Ekblad and Montour return, they should be a force to be reckoned with. Until then, I can’t justify putting them as a Cup contender, especially with Bobrovsky’s play being a huge question mark.</p>

<strong><em>Stanley Cup Odds (DraftKings):</em></strong> +1600</p>
<p>I can’t imagine how it must feel to be a Bruins fan right now. Your team is seemingly unbeatable. They truly cannot lose. They set the NHL record for wins in a season, beating the Tampa Bay Lightning from a few years ago. But don’t get too excited. Remember what happened to them? Surely there’s no way you can go out in a more embarrassing, heartbreaking way, right? Well….</p>
<p>It started off good. They dominated the Panthers for the majority of the first four games. They took a 3-1 series lead going back home for game 5. They only had one three-game losing streak <em>all season</em>. With game 5 tied nearing the end of regulation, the puck made its way to the stick of Brad Marchand who got free for a breakaway. With under a second to go, he ripped a shot that could’ve won the series, but Sergei Bobrovsky made a pad save. The best team of all time would go on to lose this game in OT. They would lose a crazy game 6, and then once again lose in OT at home in game 7. This wasn’t like the Lightning choke. This is something entirely different, and yet almost worse. They had a third period lead in both game 6 and 7. They had chances to win the series, even past Marchand’s breakaway. If they win this series, who knows? The Panthers made the Final, so it seems likely that the Bruins could have done the same.</p>
<p>To rub salt in the wounds, the team took some big losses in the offseason. Captain Patrice Bergeron and David Krejci both decided to hang up the skates, leaving a gaping hole at the center position. Trade deadline acquisitions Dmitry Orlov and Tyler Bertuzzi both left in free agency. They were able to get back some depth with players such as Morgan Geekie and Kevin Shattenkirk, but overall, the team is much worse than the record setting team from last season.</p>
<p>Even still, they have plenty of talent. David Pastrnak is coming off a 61 goal season. Charlie McAvoy continues to be one of the best defenders in the league. The center position is concerning. Pavel Zacha showed potential for being a capable 1C last year. Can he keep it up? Is Charlie Coyle really the 2C? I expect them to explore options at the trade deadline. The free agent class was a weak one, and they were unsure of the future of Bergeron and Krejci. I’m also expecting a come to Earth season from Linus Ullmark. I expect him and Jeremy Swayman to split starts.</p>
<p>So, they will not be anywhere close to breaking the wins record this year. But they still have plenty of talent and good goaltending. They’ll still be in the mix, but winning the Cup is going to be a whole lot tougher.</p>

<strong><em>Key Departures:</em></strong> Patrick Maroon, Corey Perry, Ross Colton, Alex Killorn, Ian Cole<br>
<strong><em>Stanley Cup Odds (DraftKings):</em></strong> +2000</p>
<p>After having won 11 straight playoff series, the Lightning have now lost two in a row. Their run was incredible, but with many teams on the rise in the Eastern Conference, I find it difficult to believe they can make another deep run. I could convince myself they could be a contender on name value alone, and because of Andrei Vasilevskiy, but I just can’t get there with this team.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I still see this team firmly making the playoffs. With talent like Brayden Point, Steven Stamkos, Nikita Kucherov, Viktor Hedman, and of course Andrei Vasilevskiy, the Lightning will still be very good. But they lack the depth they had in the Cup runs. Gone are the days of the Yanni Gourde, Blake Coleman, Barclay Goodrow, Ondrej Palat, Ross Colton, I could go on. The bottom six is a huge question mark.</p>
<p>Even with many teams in the Atlantic improving and gunning for teams such as the Lightning and Bruins, I see them finishing at worst 4th in the division. If Vasilevskiy can stay on top of his game, there’s a chance they could get back to the Final. I certainly wouldn’t be shocked if it happens, just a bit surprised.</p>

<strong><em>Stanley Cup Odds (DraftKings):</em></strong> +2200</p>
<p>The Kings’ rebuild has been very interesting to watch unfold. At first, it seemed like they would build the roster around the young talent they had drafted. Their prospect pool was one of the best. Then, they decided to make big trades and go after big fish in free agency. It’s gotten them two straight playoff appearances and they are in position to make it three.</p>
<p>Some of the big names they’ve acquired in the past few years include: Phillip Danault, Kevin Fiala, Pierre-Luc Dubois, Viktor Arvidsson, and Vladislav Gavrikov. The new look Kings have found success by controlling play, ranking 9th in MoneyPuck.com’s expected goal share last season. Adding Pierre-Luc Dobois will cerainly help boost offensive output. However, the overall team defense took a big hit this offseason. the lost defenders Sean Walker and Sean Durzi as well as solid defensive forward Alex Iafallo and Gabriel Vilardi in the Dubois trade. Youngster Brandt Clarke will help shore up the defensive unit.</p>
<p>The goaltending will be interesting to watch. Pheonix Copley was a surprise last year, and they brought in veteran Cam Talbot to fight for the starting job. I expect the Pacific division to be a dogfight this year, so the Kings will need them to step up big. We saw what happened to the Flames last season. Overall, they have talent, but realistically I don’t see them competing for the Cup quite yet.</p>

<strong><em>Stanley Cup Odds (DraftKings):</em></strong> +3500</p>
<p>The Kraken have been released. After a pitiful first season, the Kraken exploded for 100 points. They secured a playoff spot and head coach Dave Hakstol secured a Jack Adams nomination. But they weren’t satisfied. They went into the defending champs’ building and won game 7 in the first round for their first series victory in franchise history. Unfortunately, they lost a hard-fought second round series to the Stars in seven games. Can they have similar success next year, or was it merely a fluke?</p>
<p>The playoffs showed the world exactly why they had become so successful so quickly: depth and balance. They were able to wear down the top-heavy Avalanche by rolling four of the most balanced lines in the league. They were getting scoring from every player in the lineup; 15 of the 20 skaters that played in the series scored a goal. None scored more than two. If that isn’t balance, I don’t know what is.</p>
<p>They did lose a few of these key depth players, but they picked up Brian Dumoulin to replace Carson Soucy and Kailer Yamamoto to round out their middle six (it feels like their whole forward core is middle six players). Andre Burakovsky missed the playoffs but will be back to provide even more scoring. Jared McCann is coming off a 40 goal season and will look to match that production. Calder Trophy winner Matty Beniers will attempt to avoid a sophomore slump.</p>
<p>Of course, we can’t discuss the Kraken without bringing up goaltending. Phillip Grubauer had another sub .900 season last year. The Kraken defense was good at suppressing shot volume and quality, but Grubauer was still letting them in. Despite this, the Kraken were able to outscore their problems. Can they do this again? If Grubauer can put it together like he did in the playoffs, this team could be scary. However, if the goaltending continues to suck, they may be on the outside looking in.</p>

<strong><em>Key Departures:</em></strong> John Klingberg, Matt Dumba, Ryan Reaves, Gustav Nyquist<br>
<strong><em>Stanley Cup Odds (DraftKings):</em></strong> +3000</p>
<p>With the Toronto Maple Leafs having finally won a first round series, I would like to start a narrative of the Wild being the first round chokers. Sure, the Wild haven’t had the same expectations, but they’ve lost their last <em>seven</em> first round series (including bubble qualifying). And that’s in a span of eight seasons. The State of Hockey hasn’t sniffed the second round since 2015 and hasn’t seen a conference final since 2003. At least they’ve won a few games (looking at you, Twins).</p>
<p>The Wild project to be a good team again. Much of this is because of Kirill Kaprizov. He is memorizing to watch. He can take over a shift and skate circles around the defense. He drives much of their scoring. The question is who can pitch in? I believe Matt Boldy will be that guy. Aside from that, I’m struggling to see where they get points. Joel Eriksson Ek is an excellent two-way forward, but his career high is 61 points last year. Realistically, the best I could see him getting to is around a point per game.</p>
<p>The defense and goaltending isn’t looking too bad. Filip Gustavsson had an excellent year last year. While he’s likely to regress some, I expect him to still be the starter, with veteran Marc-Andre Fleury acting as the backup. The d-core definitely isn’t flashy, but they are led by captain Jared Spurgeon who’s received Norris votes the last two seasons. Jonas Brodin is an underrated shutdown defender who can chip in offensively from time to time.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for the Wild, I don’t believe they will win the division. That means if they make the playoffs (I wouldn’t be shocked if they missed), they’ll likely be matched up against either the Stars or Avalanche, two teams I view as much better than them. So, it could be another early exit for the Wild.</p>

<strong><em>Stanley Cup Odds (DraftKings):</em></strong> +3000</p>
<p>Last season was so strange. After losing their franchise player to free agency, and their other superstar requesting a trade, somehow former GM Brad Treliving was able to push all the right buttons. The new look Flames were as good, or even better than before? Or so we thought.</p>
<p>To be honest, we should have seen this coming. With so many new faces, the Flames struggled. Jonathan Huberdeau couldn’t find his game under Darryl Sutter. Nazem Kadri didn’t live up to the hype after having a career year the year prior. 2021-22 Vezina finalist Jakob Markstrom was terrible. And yet, despite this, they finished with 93 points and barely missed the playoffs.</p>
<p>I’m a believer that the Flames will have a big comeback season this year. Can it really get worse than last year? New head coach Ryan Huska will implement a new system that will hopefully revitalize guys like Huberdeau and Kadri. Markstrom has to be better, but I believe he will be. They have one of the better d-cores in the league. There’s no reason this team shouldn’t make the playoffs this year.</p>
<p>However, I can’t justify putting them higher in the rankings until they prove me right. Hopefully.</p>

<strong><em>Stanley Cup Odds (DraftKings):</em></strong> +2800</p>
<p>Has your aging defenseman recently had a 100 point season but you are paying him far too much and he doesn’t fit your timeline? Are you a free agent looking for a new home? Better Call Kyle! With the Penguins having barely missed the playoffs, they decided it was time for an overhaul of the front office. In comes Kyle Dubas to make some changes.</p>
<p>The Penguins will quite possibly be the most intriguing team to watch this season. This team would have been unstoppable in 2016 (well, so was that Pens team). But now, in 2023, all of their best players are well into their 30’s. We know what Sidney Crosby brings to the table. Even at his age, he’s still producing at an elite level. Newly acquired Erik Karlsson decided to have a career year and surpass 100 points as a defender. I’m skeptical that he can do this again, even on a much better team. Evgeni Malkin and Kris Letang seem to have a little left in the tank. Scoring shouldn’t be an issue for this squad, especially when jake Guentzel returns from injury.</p>
<p>My concern for the Penguins is that these old albeit talented players won’t be able to keep up with younger, faster teams. Karlsson and Letang are traffic cones on defense to begin with, and another year older will likely not help this case. Jeff Carter is projected to still be in the lineup after having an awful year. Tristan Jarry will have to carry the load; I expect a lot of shots coming his way this season.</p>
<p>The Penguins should be competitive but I wouldn’t expect them to make too much noise in the playoffs. Ultimately, there’s a chance they fall just short once again.</p>

<strong><em>Key Departures:</em></strong> Ilya Lyubushkin<br>
<strong><em>Stanley Cup Odds (DraftKings):</em></strong> +3500</p>
<p>It’s that time of year again. Let the Sabres hype begin! They’ll have a good first few weeks and we’ll all be convinced that this is the year they make the playoffs. They’ll follow it up with an absolute stinker of a month, fall to the depth of the standings and finish the year with a top 10 pick. The same old story. Or is it?</p>
<p>Last years Sabres followed the script, up to a point. Of course, people were wondering if it could be the year. They started strong, winning seven of their first 10 games. So far, so good. They then lost 11 of 14. Just like I thought. But this is where they broke script. They fought back. They were within reach of the playoffs. They fell one point short. One less point in the regular season than the eventual Eastern Conference Champions. Brutal.</p>
<p>So, here we are once again. Will it be the year? Many seem to think so, and for good reason. This team is young and talented. They didn’t lose any big pieces. While they didn’t add too much either, they should be better due to the progression of their rising stars.</p>
<p>One player who needs no introduction is Tage Thompson. He scores goals in troves, and nearly every single one is electrifying. Rasmus Dahlin broke out last year and finished 8th in Norris voting (personally I would have had him much higher). Dahlin is one of the best young defenders in the game, and will be a perennial Norris candidate alongside other young star defenseman (Makar, Fox, Heiskanen, Hughes, to name a few). With those guys leading the way, the Sabres have many young players who will have plenty of opportunity to improve their game: Dylan Cozens, Owen Power, Jack Quinn, Peyton Krebs, and JJ Peterka will all play significant roles on this team. They are all under 23 years old. Oh, and I forgot! Highly touted goalie prospect Devon Levi will look to be the starter for the Sabres. He went 5-2 in seven starts at the end of last season. He’s only 21.</p>
<p>But with youth comes inexperience. I want to believe that this is the year they make the playoffs, but there will be little room for error in a very competitive eastern conference. If they string together some losses, will they be able to get back on track? At the very least, they should be a very entertaining watch.</p>

<strong><em>Key Departures:</em></strong> Pierre-Luc Dubois, Blake Wheeler<br>
<strong><em>Stanley Cup Odds (DraftKings):</em></strong> +5000</p>
<p>I don’t know how the feel about the Jets. They just made the playoffs. There seemed to be a rift in the locker room. Head coach Rick Bowness called out his team to the media, and some players had issue with the way the situation was handled. Bowness returns, and his group will look slightly different. Former captain Blake Wheeler is gone. Pierre-Luc Dubois has seemingly wanted out since he got there. He’s gone. In return for Dubois, they got some good pieces. Alex Iafallo and Gabriel Vilardi are both capable middle six players. Trade rumors were swirling about both Connor Hellebuyck and Mark Scheifele. They are both UFA’s after this season. However, they held on to them both.</p>
<p>So, on paper the Jets look like they should be in the mix once again. However, if things go sideways even a little, they could look to sell at the deadline. I’ll be curious to see how the handle the trade deadline if they’re in a playoff position. Would they hold pat? Or would they go all in to take one stab at it knowing they’re likely entering a retool anyway? The Central division has some question marks, so it seems within reason that they could sneak into the three spot.</p>

<p><strong><em>Key Additions:</em></strong> Julien Gauthier <strong><em>Key Departures:</em></strong> Josh Bailey<br>
<strong><em>Stanley Cup Odds (DraftKings):</em></strong> +5000</p>
<p>Last season, I thought the Islanders would miss the playoffs. I thought that before the season, I thought that during the season. I believed this up until the second-last day of the season. Well, I hate to say it Islanders: I’m still not a believer. Maybe it’s because every time I watch an Islanders game I have to take a break to watch paint dry, which is far more entertaining. It could be because I just think they’re not very good.</p>
<p>Of course, it helps having arguably a top-2 (top-1?) goalie in the game. Ilya Sorokin will start the season as the favorite for the Vezina Trophy (+400 on DraftKings). He will be unquestionably the teams most important player. Aside from him, this roster is….meh. Their supposed star, Mathew Barzal, hasn’t surpassed 62 points since his rookie year (yes, he was on pace a couple years, but let me have my narrative). They insist on playing a fourth line of Matt Martin, Casey Cizikas, and Cal Clutterbuck. Why? The second and third lines don’t move me either.</p>
<p>When it comes to the Islanders, you know what you’re getting. Good defensive structure, great goaltending, and an offense that puts even babies to sleep. They have proven that they can rely on this strategy to make the playoffs and do well. This could very well be the case again this year. However, my guts says a team like the Penguins or Sabres make it in over them. The eastern wild card race should once again be a fun one.</p>

<strong><em>Stanley Cup Odds (DraftKings):</em></strong> +3500</p>
<p>Speaking of the wild card race in the east, the Ottawa Senators are a team that should be in the hunt. Last season was supposed to be that year, but a season ending injury to Josh Norris early in the season set them back too far. Alex DeBrincat couldn’t find his scoring touch and didn’t seem happy in Ottawa, so he got shipped to Detroit for Dominik Kubalik and other pieces.</p>
<p>However, not all was bad. Tim Stutzle emerged as a star, putting up 90 points in 78 games. Brady Tkachuk had 83. Both these guys are young and should continue their upward trend. On the defensive side, they traded for Jakob Chychrun, giving Thomas Chabot some help. Rookie Jake Sanderson had a quietly great year, putting up 32 points while being good in the defensive zone. At only 21, he has the potential to emerge as another young superstar defenseman. In the offseason, they brought in Vladimir Tarasenko and Joonas Korpisalo.</p>
<p>The expectations are high for this team. They should be in the hunt for a wild card spot as the year ends. My hunch is that they’ll more than likely miss, but they have 2022 Devils breakout potential and will be a fun team to follow.</p>

<strong><em>Stanley Cup Odds (DraftKings):</em></strong> +7500</p>
<p>The Barry Trotz era is here in Nashville. After many years of David Poile doing a phenomenal job keeping the Predators relevant, they now hand the keys to Trotz, and the team already looks quite different. Matt Duchene and Ryan Johansen are gone. They picked up Ryan O’Reilly and Luke Schenn. Last season, Tommy Novak came out of nowhere and ended up third in scoring having only played 51 games.</p>
<p>While they won’t overwhelm anyone with superstar firepower, the Predators will be an interesting sleeper team to keep an eye. They’ve got an interesting mix of older skilled players (O’Reilly, Roman Josi, Tyson Barrie, Filip Forsberg) and young/unproven players (Novak, Juuso Parssinen, Philip Tomasino, Luke Evangelista). In my mind, this makes them highly unpredictable. Juuse Saros will almost assuredly be a rock in net. The skaters…who knows? I’ve mentioned several times I believe the middle of the Central is wide open this season. If it all clicks and the young guys produce, this team could steal a spot. They also might miss by a lot. I really don’t know. My prediction: between 60-120 points (bold, I know).</p>

<p>Who is the face of the Blues now? Ryan O’Reilly and Vladimir Tarasenko are gone leaving the Blues with no one as “the guy”. Who on the roster will step up and be just that? Well, there aren’t too many options. They’re paying Robert Thomas and Jordan Kyrou $8 million apiece. One or both of them need to step up in a big way. Aside from those two, the best options are Pavel Buchnevich and Jakub Vrana. You could argue Binnington is the face of the franchise. He led them to the Cup victory and is always involved in on-ice shenanigans, but his play as of late hasn’t warranted “face of the franchise” treatment.</p>
<p>With a myriad of alright players, the Blues will more than likely be just okay. I see their ceiling as being a wild card team and their floor as a top 10 draft pick.</p>

<p><strong><em>Key Additions:</em></strong> Alex DeBrincat, JT Compher, Justin Holl, Klim Kostin, Jeff Petry, Shayne Gostisbehere, Daniel Sprong <strong><em>Key Departures:</em></strong> Dominik Kubalik, Pius Suter, Alex Nedeljkovic, Filip Zadina<br>
<strong><em>Stanley Cup Odds (DraftKings):</em></strong> +7500</p>
<p>Buffalo Sabres. Ottawa Senators. Detroit Red Wings. These three teams have been tied at the hip for the last few years. For starters, they all play in the Atlantic division. They’ve all been on a similar trajectory with their rebuilds. Now, many believe it’s time for them to make the playoffs. Unfortunately for them, they’ll be fighting each other, as well as the better teams in the Atlantic. Of the three, I’m least bullish about the Red Wings.</p>
<p>This offseason was a particularly interesting one for the Yzerplan. Many new names are coming to Hockeytown, but can they help get in the playoffs? If Alex DeBrincat can return to form, he’s a great addition to the top six. Klim Kostin and Daniel Sprong are good depth pickups. The most interesting signing was JT Compher. After having increased opportunity in Colorado last year, he put up career highs. I’m not sure I can see him sustaining this. We saw what happened to Nazem Kadri. Compher is a good defender, but if he’s going to be the 2C in Detroit, they’ll need him to maintain or even increase his production.</p>
<p>The d-core that Yzerman has constructed is…something. Seider and Walman are a great first pair. That leaves Jeff Petry, Ben Chiarot, Justin Holl, and Shayne Gostisbehere. To me, this seems like a disaster waiting to happen. Chiarot and Gostisbehere provide very little on the defensive side, and Holl definitely has his struggles on that end too. This seems like a unit that will bleed chances, and can we really expect Ville Husso and James Reimer to save them?</p>
<p>So, when it comes to the Atlantic 3 making the playoffs, I believe the Red Wings are least likely to get it done this year. They could prove me wrong, though.</p>

<strong><em>Stanley Cup Odds (DraftKings):</em></strong> +7500</p>
<p>Will the Capitals make the playoffs? Maybe. Probably not. Who cares?! This core has their Cup, and now there is only one thing left to do. We all know what I’m referring to.</p>
<p>NHL Goals Leaders, All Time:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Wayne Gretzky: 894</li>
<li>Alexander Ovechkin: 822</li>
</ol>
<p>Now of course, 73 goals is unfeasible in one season. However, I doubt he wants this to take too long. He’ll have to average 36.5 goals over the next two seasons to surpass the Great One. He had 42 last season. His teammates will be feeding him. Even at his age, I wouldn’t be surprised if he hits 50 this year.</p>

<p><strong><em>Key Additions:</em></strong> Damon Severson, Ivan Provorov, Adam Fantilli<br>
<strong><em>Key Departures:</em></strong> None<br>
<strong><em>Stanley Cup Odds (DraftKings):</em></strong> +15000</p>
<p>It feels as if the Blue Jackets believe they can be a playoff team. Now, on the surface this seems crazy. They finished last year with 59 point, 2nd worst in the league. That fact doesn’t exactly indicate <em>playoff team</em>. However, I don’t think it’s a stretch to say they have an outside chance.</p>
<p>To start, they didn’t have any key departures. That’s always a bonus. It’s their additions that could make this team a sleeper. To start, their best defender in Zach Werenski only played 13 games last year. His return will improve this team immensely by himself. They’ll be bolstering their d-core by adding Damon Severson and Ivan Provorov. Lastly, sucking so bad last year earned them quite the prize. No, they didn’t get Connor Bedard. But the Ducks shockingly passed on Adam Fantilli at pick 2 and the Blue Jackets jumped at the opportunity. Fantilli should instantly slot into the top six. The extent of his impact is unknown, but he has a high ceiling. He’ll likely be playing alongside other young guys in Kent Johnson and Kirill Marchenko which will make for a fun watch.</p>
<p>Johnny Gaudreau had a down year last season for his standards, but we know what he can be. Just two seasons ago he put up a whopping 115 points. He is 30 years old which begs the question, can he bounce back? I don’t see him touching 115 again, but I believe 100 is within reach. Ultimately, the Blue Jackets are in position to have a much better season, but how much better will it be?</p>

<p><strong><em>Key Additions:</em></strong> Alex Newhook, Casey DeSmith <strong><em>Key Departures:</em></strong> Joel Edmundson, Jonathan Drouin<br>
<strong><em>Stanley Cup Odds (DraftKings):</em></strong> +25000</p>
<p>The Canadiens’ run to the Stanley Cup Final in 2021 was truly special. IN a normal year, they probably don’t even make the playoffs. However, they were in a weak Northern division. They took advantage. Props to them. The years since haven’t been so kind. After making the Final, they fell to the bottom of te league, picking first overall in 2022. Last season, they picked 5th. It would seem as if they’ll be picking high again this year.</p>
<p>While the roster isn’t great, they do have a lot of young players. Nick Suzuki and Cole Caufield are the “franchise” guys. they are very good players with a lot of room to grow. With the first pick in 2022, they took Juraj Slafkovsky. He was a bit underwhelming in 39 games last year but he has potential. Remember, not all first overall picks breakout in year one. They traded for Alex Newhook who has shown flashes of talent but hasn’t been able to put together consistency yet. Keep an eye out for Raphael Harvey-Pinard who looked very good in 34 games last season.</p>
<p>So, they won’t be making a push for the playoffs, but there’s reason to believe they will be better this season.</p>

<section id="chicago-blackhawks" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="chicago-blackhawks">1. Chicago Blackhawks</h4>
<p><strong><em>Key Additions:</em></strong> Connor Bedard, Taylor Hall, Corey Perry, Nick Foligno, Josh Bailey, Ryan Donato<br>
<strong><em>Key Departures:</em></strong> Caleb Jones, Jonathan Toews<br>
<strong><em>Stanley Cup Odds (DraftKings):</em></strong> +20000</p>
<p>Expectations are a tough thing to manage. Connor Bedard has received well deserved hype. But is there any way he can actually live up to these lofty expectations in year one? Let’s take a look at what some other notable rookies have done. Connor McDavid put up 48 points in an injury-shortened season. Sidney Crosby had 102 points in 81 games during his rookie year. Auston Matthews put up 40 goals in his. If he starts his career anything like those guys, 100 points is well within reach.</p>
<p>Let’s be optimistic and say Bedard will be everything we expect him to be. How much can he alone carry this team? The truth is, the Blackhawks’ roster is still a heaping pile of garbage. I don’t know how else to put it. For some reason, instead of trying to surround Bedard with young talent, they brought in a bunch of washed veterans. I know it was a weak free agency class, but this the best we could do? Truly baffling. They’ll likely be near the bottom of the standings, with a chance to get 1st overall in back to back years.</p>

<strong><em>Stanley Cup Odds (DraftKings):</em></strong> +25000</p>
<p>The Ducks were sooooo close to Bedard. Soooo close. Personally, this is the destination I wanted him to land. Watching Trevor Zegras, Troy Terry, Mason McTavish, and Connor Bedard terrorize the league. Now we get to watch Bedard terrorize the league with….Taylor Hall and Corey Perry? Yuck. The Ducks consolation prize is no slouch though. Adam Fantilli, while not Bedard, could be a super….wait…sorry…I’m getting word that they passed on Fantilli? I don’t think anyone saw that coming.</p>
<p>I don’t know much about Leo Carlsson. I can’t say I follow draft prospects too closely aside from the top couple. He’s probably a very good player. We’ll get to find out very soon. He should play in the NHL this season. He supposedly looked very good at development camp.</p>
<p>Another young guy trying to break out will be Jamie Drysdale. He only played 8 games last year, but the season prior he had 32 points in 81 games.</p>
<p>Bringing in Alex Killorn on <em>that</em> contract was certainly a choice, but he’ll help their top six and provide some veteran, championship experience to help the young guys. Their time is coming. It may still be a couple more years before we see them competing for the playoffs, but they’re heading in the right direction.</p>

<span id="cb1-13"><a href="#cb1-13" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The NHL season is right around the corner. So, why not rank teams based on where they stand? This ranking is bound to look awful by mid-November. It's impossible to know how these teams will look on the ice until we see it. But, it's fun to speculate. So, here is my August edition of the Power Rankings!</span>

<span id="cb1-28"><a href="#cb1-28" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Vegas will try to run it back on the back of a strong lineup top to bottom. It starts with Jack Eichel, who had a great playoffs. I expect him to return to being a superstar this year. Last year, he had 66 points in 67 games following his injury. I could see him eclipsing 100 if he plays the full season. The rest of the forward core remains deep, even after trading away an original Golden Misfit, Reilly Smith. Mark Stone continues to be a two-way star when healthy, Conn Smythe Trophy winner Jonathan Marchessault should continue putting up solid numbers, and they re-signed Ivan Barbashev who was outstanding for them in their run.</span>
<span id="cb1-29"><a href="#cb1-29" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-30"><a href="#cb1-30" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The defense is also incredible, one through six. They will continue to be incredibly tough to play against. The only minor question is in net. Adin Hill did have a spectacular playoff run. With Brossoit out the door, it's his job for now. He's never had more than 27 starts in a season. How will he hold up?</span>
<span id="cb1-31"><a href="#cb1-31" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-32"><a href="#cb1-32" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Ultimately, this team is poised to make another run. The Pacific division will be tougher than in years past, but they should have no problem securing a top three spot.</span>

<span id="cb1-42"><a href="#cb1-42" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Looking at the Hurricanes' roster makes me wonder if the Golden Knights are actually as deep as I claimed. The Hurricanes took a deep roster and made it deeper with many offseason additions. They have eight, yes eight, NHL caliber defenseman on thier roster. Jaccob Slavin, Brent Burns, Brett Pesce, Brady Skjei, and Jalen Chatfield return from last season. Already a great unit. So the Hurricanes decide to add Dmitry Orlov, Tony DeAngelo, and Caleb Jones! That's ridiculous! It will be intersting to see who gets ice time early on, but there's no doubt that the Hurricanes have the most defensive depth in the league.</span>
<span id="cb1-43"><a href="#cb1-43" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-44"><a href="#cb1-44" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The forward group is also very deep. They lost Max Pacioretty, but did they ever really have him? So they went out and got Michael Bunting who will help bolster the Hurricanes top six. Now while they are deep, the biggest question for the Hurricanes is will they be able to find elite top-level scoring? This seems to be the struggle every year. You may think, "Well, they have Sebastian Aho". There's no denying that Aho is an elite play driver. However is career high in points (I was shocked when I looked this up) is only 83. He's been right around a point per game for the last six seasons. It feels like he should be able to take the next step. Or maybe not. Maybe this is who he is, or maybe it's the system. If the Canes want to go far, he needs to be "*the* guy". Who else is going to be "*the* guy"? Andrei Svechnikov has superstar potential and is only 23, but I wouldn't expect a big jump from him coming off an ACL tear. Young guys like Seth Jarvis and Jesperi Kotkaniemi could make a leap, but would it be enough? So while they are deep, they are just that, deep. I expect their games to one again be a defensive slog.</span>
<span id="cb1-45"><a href="#cb1-45" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-46"><a href="#cb1-46" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>As far as goaltending, they seem to be running it back with Frederik Andersen and Antti Raanta with Pyotr Kochetkov waiting in the wings for when one (or both) of them get injured. I'm not too worried about the goaltending for the regular season. The Hurricanes system should be able to make any goaltender look good (just ask David Ayres). Can Andersen and Raanta be healthy for a playoff run is the real concern. Or will Kochetkov take the starting job? Barring a disaster, the Hurricanes will once again be in position to make a run. Can they finally get over the hump and win an Eastern Conference Final game (and maybe the Cup too)?</span>

<span id="cb1-55"><a href="#cb1-55" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>After being beat out by one point for the Central division title last year, I believe this is the year that Stars take that title. As a whole, the Central Division is weaker than in years past. The Predators and Blues have entered retools and the Wild didn't improve during the offseason. I view this as a two horse race, and the Avalanche have many new pieces that could take time to gel. The Stars are a young team coming off a Western Conference Final appearance. By my measure, they're the team to beat in the Central.</span>
<span id="cb1-56"><a href="#cb1-56" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-57"><a href="#cb1-57" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The Stars' top line has an argument for the best in the league. First of all, they've found a superstar in Jason Robertson. I believe he can put up an MVP-caliber season. Of course, Connor McDavid will likely win it, but I can't even find odds for Robertson to win the award, which seems crazy given that he just put up 109 points. Next up is the man who seems to get better with age, Joe Pavelski. After setting a new career high in points in 2021-22 with 81, he followed it up with 77. On top of that, he continues to be a defensive menace. To round it out, they've got another emerging superstar in Roope Hintz. Those in the analytics community have known about Hintz for some time, and the past two seasons he's made a name for himself in the league. Alongside Robertson and Pavelski, I believe he can have a 90+ point season.</span>
<span id="cb1-58"><a href="#cb1-58" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-59"><a href="#cb1-59" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Past the first line, they've got some intriguing players. Wyatt Johnston is coming off an incredible rookie season. They signed Matt Duchene who should help round out the middle six. Tyler Seguin and Jamie Benn are aging, but could still provide some value.</span>
<span id="cb1-60"><a href="#cb1-60" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The defensive unit is also intriguing. They are led by a two-way star in Miro Heiskanen, who should once again be in the Norris Trophy conversation.</span>
<span id="cb1-61"><a href="#cb1-61" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-62"><a href="#cb1-62" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>And, of course, they have a proven goalie. Jake Oettinger followed up an incredible playoff performance in 2022 with a great year, finishing 5th in Vezina voting. He did struggle in this years playoffs, but was good enough to get them nine wins. If the Stars can get him playing like he was in the Flames series for a whole playoff run, they could very well be unbeatable.</span>

<span id="cb1-71"><a href="#cb1-71" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The 2021-22 Avalanche were one of the best teams in the salary cap era. After amassing 119 points in the regular season, they rolled through the playoffs, winning thhe cup with a 16-4 record and never trailing in a series. Last season was a different story. First of all, they lost a lot of scoring and depth to free agency, the most notable being Nazem Kadri and Andre Burakovsky. On top of that, they could never stay healthy. Captain Gabriel Landeskog missed the entire season with a knee injury, and most everyone else was in and out of the lineup. Nothing could go right.</span>
<span id="cb1-72"><a href="#cb1-72" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-73"><a href="#cb1-73" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Even after a disappointing season, the Avs' window is still wide open, and they should remain one of the best teams in the league. There's no denying their core is one of the best in the league, if not the best. Nathan MacKinnon, Cale Makar, and Mikko Rantanen are all superstars. Makar's defensive partner, Devon Toews, is a two-way savant. Valeri Nichushkin and Artturi Lehkonen are incredible forechecking wingers. Through all of the challenges they faced last season, this core was still able to win the Central division and take the feisty Kraken to 7 games.</span>
<span id="cb1-74"><a href="#cb1-74" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-75"><a href="#cb1-75" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The question for the Avs is if they can get secondary production. With even more forwards leaving in free agency, and Landeskog slated to miss *another* year, GM Chris MacFarland brought in some new names that they're hoping can fill the void and give the big guys some much needed help. Ryan Johansen comes over from the Predators and will likely be the second line center. Can he have a bounce back year on a new team? They brought in Ross Colton and Miles Wood to add speed and tenacity to the bottom six. Lastly, they signed Jonathan Drouin, who will reunite with former Halifax Mooseheads teammate Nathan MacKinnon. Can MacKinnon reignite Drouin?</span>
<span id="cb1-76"><a href="#cb1-76" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-77"><a href="#cb1-77" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The defense and goaltending remain largely the same. Barring injuries (to either himself or defenders), I would expect another solid year for Alexandar Georgiev. The Avs have proven that goalies can thrive behind their system. Ultimately, there are some questions with scoring depth, but the Avs have all the pieces to get a second cup with this core.</span>

<span id="cb1-86"><a href="#cb1-86" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Last season was a disaster. The Devils came into the season with expectations of making the playoffs for the first time since 2018. However, they just couldn't put it together. Nothing seemed to go right and chants of "Fire Lindy" rained down from appalled fans. Well, that is, for all of two games (yes, Devils fans were actually chanting this after two games).</span>
<span id="cb1-87"><a href="#cb1-87" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-88"><a href="#cb1-88" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>After this disastrous, horrendous, unforgivable start, the Devils won 21 of their next 24 games and finished the season with the most points in franchise history. Not too shabby, Lindy (fans made it up to him by chanting "Sorry Lindy"). The truth is, the Devils were truly unstoppable for a good part of the year. They were a well-oiled, play controlling machine. They finished the year with the second best expected goals share (Moneypuck.com) bested by only the Hurricanes, the team they would eventually fall to in the second round.</span>
<span id="cb1-89"><a href="#cb1-89" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-90"><a href="#cb1-90" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The plethora of young star power on this team is astounding. Jack Hughes is on the brink of super stardom, falling one point shy of 100 last season. He's only 22, and should continue to rise the ranks of the leagues best. Nico Hischier may just be the most underrated player in the league. This Swiss army knife does just about everything at an elite level, and with Patrice Bergeron retired, he should be a leading candidate for the Selke Trophy. Add to them Jesper Bratt, Dawson Mercer, Timo Meier, and newly acquired Tyler Toffoli, this unit looks devilishly good.</span>
<span id="cb1-91"><a href="#cb1-91" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-92"><a href="#cb1-92" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The defense should hold it's own as well. They are led by Dougie Hamilton and Jonas Siegenthaler. Damon Severson and Ryan Graves are gone, but filling in is Jack's brother, Luke Hughes. Luke showed flashes of brilliance in the few games he played last season. Take away overwhelming favorite Connor Bedard and Luke Hughes would be the Calder Trophy favorite (Bedard: -140, Hughes: +550). The goaltending is a question mark, but Akira Schmid looked like he could hold his own.</span>
<span id="cb1-93"><a href="#cb1-93" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-94"><a href="#cb1-94" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The Eastern Conference and the Metro division are stacked once again, but I'm confident the Devils will be near the top of the standings when all is said and done. Their window is all the way open and they'll be contenders for years to come.</span>

<span id="cb1-103"><a href="#cb1-103" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Is this the year Connor McDavid finally gets his Cup? It feels like we've been asking this question for a few years now. Although the past two years have ended in defeat, the Oilers have been right in the thick of it, losing to eventual Cup champs in both seasons. Maybe this year will end differently.</span>
<span id="cb1-104"><a href="#cb1-104" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-105"><a href="#cb1-105" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The Oilers will have no problem scoring. Connor McDavid is unquestionably the best player in the league. Last season, he put up a monstrous 153 points, numbers we haven't seen since the 90's. His running mate, Leon Draisaitl was no slouch himself putting up 128 points. With those two weapons, the Oilers were scoring at will. This is especially true for the power play, which was the best in league history. Even in the playoffs, the power play was clipping along at, _\*checks notes\*_, 46.1 percent!</span>
<span id="cb1-106"><a href="#cb1-106" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-107"><a href="#cb1-107" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>With this scoring attack, the Oilers should be in line to make the playoffs yet again. However, how far can their defense and goaltending take them? Team defense for the Oilers has been a problem over the past few years. Adding Mattias Ekholm at the deadline certainly helped, but is that enough? With a weak free agency class, they did nothing to address their d-core in the offseason. They might look to the trade deadline once again if things aren't looking good. And there are still questions in net. Jack Campbell is looking to bounce back after a horrendous year. Although rookie Stuart Skinner had a solid regular season earning him a Calder Trophy nomination, he struggled in the playoffs. Can either of them assert themselves as the number one option? The Oilers' season could depend on it.</span>

<span id="cb1-118"><a href="#cb1-118" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>As it turned out, that team that barely made the playoffs turned out to get as hot as the sun and disposed of the Leafs in 5 games. It was a quick and disappointing exit for the Leafs after such a historical moment in the round previous. Now, they've once again got to pick up the pieces and evaluate if they really are a Stanley Cup contender. After a disagreement in the front office, GM Kyle Dubas is out the door. It is now up to Brad Treliving to find away to help this team get over the hump.</span>
<span id="cb1-119"><a href="#cb1-119" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-120"><a href="#cb1-120" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>This team has all the talent to be a contender. They've shown it in the regular season for years now. Last year, they finally proved they could win in the playoffs. Sure, it was only one round. But they now know they can win. For the Leafs, it starts up front with two elite talents in Auston Matthews and Mitch Marner. Matthews had a "down" year last year, scoring "only" 40 goals in 74 games played. He should bounce back this year, and could once again eclipse 60. Marner is an elite play maker, but struggles in the playoffs. Well, he did. Last season, he finally put together a solid playoff performance. They ended up holding on to William Nylander who will once again play alongside John Tavares. And then, in the offseason, they added Tyler Bertuzzi and Max Domi. That's an impressive top six. Rookie Matthew Knies could also slot in to the top six after playing an important role in the playoffs. If he does see significant time in the top six, Knies could garner a lot of Calder attention.</span>

<span id="cb1-122"><a href="#cb1-122" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The defense isn't going to knock anyone's socks off, but they have some good pieces. Morgan Rielly is a strictly offensive defenseman and he plays his role very well. They also brought in John Klingberg, who provides even less defensive resitance but should help the second unit power play. As far as shutdown guys, they have TJ Brodie, Jake McCabe, and veteran Mark Giordano. Overall, it's a solid d-core.</span>

<span id="cb1-124"><a href="#cb1-124" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Of course, as with many teams, the goaltending is a question mark. However, it should be good enough to get them into the playoffs as a top three Atlantic team. And, the 2021-22 Avalanche proved that you don't necessarily need the best goaltending to win the Cup if you're good enough. Are they good enough?</span>

<span id="cb1-133"><a href="#cb1-133" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The Rangers sneak into the Cup Contenders category for one reason and one reason alone: Igor Shesterkin. If you're a good team  with a goaltender as consistently great as Shesterkin, I believe that makes you a contender. And that is what I believe the Rangers are. A good team. I just don't know if they're a great team yet.</span>
<span id="cb1-134"><a href="#cb1-134" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-135"><a href="#cb1-135" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>They did make an impressive run to the Eastern Conference Final in 2022, and had another good season this year, falling to the young and emerging Devils in seven games. They have top end talent in Artemi Panarin, Mika Zibanejad, and Adam Fox. Chris Kreider, even at age 32, remains a very good goal scorer.</span>
<span id="cb1-136"><a href="#cb1-136" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-137"><a href="#cb1-137" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>I believe the key for this team to jump from good to great is the progression of their young talent. Kaapo Kakko, Filip Chytil, and Alexis Lafreniere need to all continue to take strides. All three have shown flashes. Can any of them find their footing and produce in a top six role? Or will they once again be stuck in third line minutes? Another guy who could take a big step is K'Andre Miller. He's only 23 and had a good season last year. If he continues his upward trend, him and Fox could be one of the better defensive duos in the league.</span>

<span id="cb1-139"><a href="#cb1-139" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Even with these questions, the Rangers have the potential to go far on the back of Shesterkin.

<span id="cb1-152"><a href="#cb1-152" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Quiz time! Who had more points last season: the Florida Panthers or the Calgary Flames? The correct answer is..... *drumroll* ....the Calgary Flames! And yet, their season will forever be viewed as a disappointment and the Panthers' will be seen as a success. The truth is, the Panthers couldn't quite put it together for the majority of the season. They couldn't find a rhythm and string together wins. They had a lot of new players and a new coach. Well, they eventually put the pieces together, and just at the right time. After squeaking into the last playoff spot in the East and falling down 3-1 in the first round, they proceeded to win 11 of 12 on their way to the Stanley Cup Final.</span>
<span id="cb1-153"><a href="#cb1-153" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-154"><a href="#cb1-154" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>They got to the final on the backs of two men: Matthew Tkachuk and Sergei Bobrovsky. The Panthers knew who they were getting when they traded for Tkachuk (and paid a steep price). He is incredible. Many analytics gurus call him a unicorn. he truly is one of a kind. No one else brings the two-way prowess like he does, as well as the intensity and grittiness. Fans of other teams hate the guy, for good reason. And then there's the ten million dollar man, Sergei Bobrovsky. Bobrovsky has, in general, been a let down in his time with the Panthers, having only one season with a save percentage above .906. But in the playoffs, he took his game to levels we hadn't seen since his Columbus days. I will always wonder who would have won the Conn Smythe had they won the Cup. It likely would have been Tkachuk given his repeated clutch goals, but take either of those guys away and they don't come close to the Final. They relied on both of them.</span>
<span id="cb1-155"><a href="#cb1-155" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-156"><a href="#cb1-156" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>I believe this will still need to be the case. They need to rely on those two guys. I have no qualms about Tkachuk to continue dominating, but can Bobrovsky put together a good season? The Panthers will be lacking defensive depth to start the season with both Aaron Ekblad and Brandon Montour recovering from injuries sustained during their run. So, they will need Bobrovsky to step up.</span>
<span id="cb1-157"><a href="#cb1-157" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-158"><a href="#cb1-158" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Heading into their second year under head coach Paul Maurice, I expect the Panthers to find a groove a bit earlier this season. They have plenty of talent up front. Once Ekblad and Montour return, they should be a force to be reckoned with. Until then, I can't justify putting them as a Cup contender, especially with Bobrovsky's play being a huge question mark.</span>

<span id="cb1-168"><a href="#cb1-168" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>I can't imagine how it must feel to be a Bruins fan right now. Your team is seemingly unbeatable. They truly cannot lose. They set the NHL record for wins in a season, beating the Tampa Bay Lightning from a few years ago. But don't get too excited. Remember what happened to them? Surely there's no way you can go out in a more embarrassing, heartbreaking way, right? Well....</span>
<span id="cb1-169"><a href="#cb1-169" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-170"><a href="#cb1-170" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>It started off good. They dominated the Panthers for the majority of the first four games. They took a 3-1 series lead going back home for game 5. They only had one three-game losing streak *all season*. With game 5 tied nearing the end of regulation, the puck made its way to the stick of Brad Marchand who got free for a breakaway. With under a second to go, he ripped a shot that could've won the series, but Sergei Bobrovsky made a pad save. The best team of all time would go on to lose this game in OT. They would lose a crazy game 6, and then once again lose in OT at home in game 7. This wasn't like the Lightning choke. This is something entirely different, and yet almost worse. They had a third period lead in both game 6 and 7. They had chances to win the series, even past Marchand's breakaway. If they win this series, who knows? The Panthers made the Final, so it seems likely that the Bruins could have done the same.</span>
<span id="cb1-171"><a href="#cb1-171" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-172"><a href="#cb1-172" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>To rub salt in the wounds, the team took some big losses in the offseason. Captain Patrice Bergeron and David Krejci both decided to hang up the skates, leaving a gaping hole at the center position. Trade deadline acquisitions Dmitry Orlov and Tyler Bertuzzi both left in free agency. They were able to get back some depth with players such as Morgan Geekie and Kevin Shattenkirk, but overall, the team is much worse than the record setting team from last season.</span>
<span id="cb1-173"><a href="#cb1-173" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-174"><a href="#cb1-174" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Even still, they have plenty of talent. David Pastrnak is coming off a 61 goal season. Charlie McAvoy continues to be one of the best defenders in the league. The center position is concerning. Pavel Zacha showed potential for being a capable 1C last year. Can he keep it up? Is Charlie Coyle really the 2C? I expect them to explore options at the trade deadline. The free agent class was a weak one, and they were unsure of the future of Bergeron and Krejci. I'm also expecting a come to Earth season from Linus Ullmark. I expect him and Jeremy Swayman to split starts.</span>
<span id="cb1-175"><a href="#cb1-175" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-176"><a href="#cb1-176" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>So, they will not be anywhere close to breaking the wins record this year.

<span id="cb1-185"><a href="#cb1-185" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>After having won 11 straight playoff series, the Lightning have now lost two in a row. Their run was incredible, but with many teams on the rise in the Eastern Conference, I find it difficult to believe they can make another deep run. I could convince myself they could be a contender on name value alone, and because of Andrei Vasilevskiy, but I just can't get there with this team.</span>
<span id="cb1-186"><a href="#cb1-186" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-187"><a href="#cb1-187" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Don't get me wrong, I still see this team firmly making the playoffs. With talent like Brayden Point, Steven Stamkos, Nikita Kucherov, Viktor Hedman, and of course Andrei Vasilevskiy, the Lightning will still be very good. But they lack the depth they had in the Cup runs. Gone are the days of the Yanni Gourde, Blake Coleman, Barclay Goodrow, Ondrej Palat, Ross Colton, I could go on. The bottom six is a huge question mark.</span>
<span id="cb1-188"><a href="#cb1-188" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-189"><a href="#cb1-189" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Even with many teams in the Atlantic improving and gunning for teams such as the Lightning and Bruins, I see them finishing at worst 4th in the division. If Vasilevskiy can stay on top of his game, there's a chance they could get back to the Final. I certainly wouldn't be shocked if it happens, just a bit surprised.</span>

<span id="cb1-198"><a href="#cb1-198" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The Kings' rebuild has been very interesting to watch unfold. At first, it seemed like they would build the roster around the young talent they had drafted. Their prospect pool was one of the best. Then, they decided to make big trades and go after big fish in free agency. It's gotten them two straight playoff appearances and they are in position to make it three.</span>
<span id="cb1-199"><a href="#cb1-199" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-200"><a href="#cb1-200" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Some of the big names they've acquired in the past few years include: Phillip Danault, Kevin Fiala, Pierre-Luc Dubois, Viktor Arvidsson, and Vladislav Gavrikov. The new look Kings have found success by controlling play, ranking 9th in MoneyPuck.com's expected goal share last season. Adding Pierre-Luc Dobois will cerainly help boost offensive output. However, the overall team defense took a big hit this offseason. the lost defenders Sean Walker and Sean Durzi as well as solid defensive forward Alex Iafallo and Gabriel Vilardi in the Dubois trade. Youngster Brandt Clarke will help shore up the defensive unit.</span>

Pheonix Copley was a surprise last year, and they brought in veteran Cam Talbot to fight for the starting job. I expect the Pacific division to be a dogfight this year, so the Kings will need them to step up big. We saw what happened to the Flames last season. Overall, they have talent, but realistically I don't see them competing for the Cup quite yet.</span>

<span id="cb1-211"><a href="#cb1-211" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The Kraken have been released. After a pitiful first season, the Kraken exploded for 100 points. They secured a playoff spot and head coach Dave Hakstol secured a Jack Adams nomination. But they weren't satisfied. They went into the defending champs' building and won game 7 in the first round for their first series victory in franchise history. Unfortunately, they lost a hard-fought second round series to the Stars in seven games. Can they have similar success next year, or was it merely a fluke?</span>
<span id="cb1-212"><a href="#cb1-212" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-213"><a href="#cb1-213" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The playoffs showed the world exactly why they had become so successful so quickly: depth and balance. They were able to wear down the top-heavy Avalanche by rolling four of the most balanced lines in the league. They were getting scoring from every player in the lineup; 15 of the 20 skaters that played in the series scored a goal. None scored more than two. If that isn't balance, I don't know what is.</span>
<span id="cb1-214"><a href="#cb1-214" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-215"><a href="#cb1-215" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>They did lose a few of these key depth players, but they picked up Brian Dumoulin to replace Carson Soucy and Kailer Yamamoto to round out their middle six (it feels like their whole forward core is middle six players). Andre Burakovsky missed the playoffs but will be back to provide even more scoring. Jared McCann is coming off a 40 goal season and will look to match that production. Calder Trophy winner Matty Beniers will attempt to avoid a sophomore slump.</span>

<span id="cb1-217"><a href="#cb1-217" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Of course, we can't discuss the Kraken without bringing up goaltending. Phillip Grubauer had another sub .900 season last year. The Kraken defense was good at suppressing shot volume and quality, but Grubauer was still letting them in. Despite this, the Kraken were able to outscore their problems. Can they do this again? If Grubauer can put it together like he did in the playoffs, this team could be scary. However, if the goaltending continues to suck, they may be on the outside looking in.</span>

<span id="cb1-227"><a href="#cb1-227" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>With the Toronto Maple Leafs having finally won a first round series, I would like to start a narrative of the Wild being the first round chokers. Sure, the Wild haven't had the same expectations, but they've lost their last *seven* first round series (including bubble qualifying). And that's in a span of eight seasons. The State of Hockey hasn't sniffed the second round since 2015 and hasn't seen a conference final since 2003. At least they've won a few games (looking at you, Twins).</span>
<span id="cb1-228"><a href="#cb1-228" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-229"><a href="#cb1-229" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The Wild project to be a good team again. Much of this is because of Kirill Kaprizov. He is memorizing to watch. He can take over a shift and skate circles around the defense. He drives much of their scoring. The question is who can pitch in? I believe Matt Boldy will be that guy. Aside from that, I'm struggling to see where they get points. Joel Eriksson Ek is an excellent two-way forward, but his career high is 61 points last year. Realistically, the best I could see him getting to is around a point per game.</span>
<span id="cb1-230"><a href="#cb1-230" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-231"><a href="#cb1-231" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The defense and goaltending isn't looking too bad. Filip Gustavsson had an excellent year last year. While he's likely to regress some, I expect him to still be the starter, with veteran Marc-Andre Fleury acting as the backup. The d-core definitely isn't flashy, but they are led by captain Jared Spurgeon who's received Norris votes the last two seasons. Jonas Brodin is an underrated shutdown defender who can chip in offensively from time to time.</span>

<span id="cb1-233"><a href="#cb1-233" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Unfortunately for the Wild, I don't believe they will win the division. That means if they make the playoffs (I wouldn't be shocked if they missed), they'll likely be matched up against either the Stars or Avalanche, two teams I view as much better than them. So, it could be another early exit for the Wild.</span>

<span id="cb1-242"><a href="#cb1-242" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Last season was so strange. After losing their franchise player to free agency, and their other superstar requesting a trade, somehow former GM Brad Treliving was able to push all the right buttons. The new look Flames were as good, or even better than before? Or so we thought.</span>
<span id="cb1-243"><a href="#cb1-243" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-244"><a href="#cb1-244" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>To be honest, we should have seen this coming. With so many new faces, the Flames struggled. Jonathan Huberdeau couldn't find his game under Darryl Sutter. Nazem Kadri didn't live up to the hype after having a career year the year prior. 2021-22 Vezina finalist Jakob Markstrom was terrible. And yet, despite this, they finished with 93 points and barely missed the playoffs.</span>
<span id="cb1-245"><a href="#cb1-245" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-246"><a href="#cb1-246" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>I'm a believer that the Flames will have a big comeback season this year. Can it really get worse than last year? New head coach Ryan Huska will implement a new system that will hopefully revitalize guys like Huberdeau and Kadri. Markstrom has to be better, but I believe he will be. They have one of the better d-cores in the league. There's no reason this team shouldn't make the playoffs this year.</span>

<span id="cb1-257"><a href="#cb1-257" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Has your aging defenseman recently had a 100 point season but you are paying him far too much and he doesn't fit your timeline? Are you a free agent looking for a new home? Better Call Kyle! With the Penguins having barely missed the playoffs, they decided it was time for an overhaul of the front office. In comes Kyle Dubas to make some changes.</span>
<span id="cb1-258"><a href="#cb1-258" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-259"><a href="#cb1-259" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The Penguins will quite possibly be the most intriguing team to watch this season. This team would have been unstoppable in 2016 (well, so was that Pens team). But now, in 2023, all of their best players are well into their 30's. We know what Sidney Crosby brings to the table. Even at his age, he's still producing at an elite level. Newly acquired Erik Karlsson decided to have a career year and surpass 100 points as a defender. I'm skeptical that he can do this again, even on a much better team. Evgeni Malkin and Kris Letang seem to have a little left in the tank. Scoring shouldn't be an issue for this squad, especially when jake Guentzel returns from injury.</span>
<span id="cb1-260"><a href="#cb1-260" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-261"><a href="#cb1-261" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>My concern for the Penguins is that these old albeit talented players won't be able to keep up with younger, faster teams. Karlsson and Letang are traffic cones on defense to begin with, and another year older will likely not help this case. Jeff Carter is projected to still be in the lineup after having an awful year. Tristan Jarry will have to carry the load; I expect a lot of shots coming his way this season.</span>
<span id="cb1-262"><a href="#cb1-262" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-263"><a href="#cb1-263" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The Penguins should be competitive but I wouldn't expect them to make too much noise in the playoffs. Ultimately, there's a chance they fall just short once again.</span>

<span id="cb1-272"><a href="#cb1-272" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>It's that time of year again. Let the Sabres hype begin! They'll have a good first few weeks and we'll all be convinced that this is the year they make the playoffs. They'll follow it up with an absolute stinker of a month, fall to the depth of the standings and finish the year with a top 10 pick. The same old story. Or is it?</span>
<span id="cb1-273"><a href="#cb1-273" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-274"><a href="#cb1-274" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Last years Sabres followed the script, up to a point. Of course, people were wondering if it could be the year. They started strong, winning seven of their first 10 games. So far, so good. They then lost 11 of 14. Just like I thought. But this is where they broke script. They fought back. They were within reach of the playoffs. They fell one point short. One less point in the regular season than the eventual Eastern Conference Champions. Brutal.</span>
<span id="cb1-275"><a href="#cb1-275" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-276"><a href="#cb1-276" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>So, here we are once again. Will it be the year? Many seem to think so, and for good reason. This team is young and talented. They didn't lose any big pieces. While they didn't add too much either, they should be better due to the progression of their rising stars.</span>
<span id="cb1-277"><a href="#cb1-277" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-278"><a href="#cb1-278" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>One player who needs no introduction is Tage Thompson. He scores goals in troves, and nearly every single one is electrifying. Rasmus Dahlin broke out last year and finished 8th in Norris voting (personally I would have had him much higher). Dahlin is one of the best young defenders in the game, and will be a perennial Norris candidate alongside other young star defenseman (Makar, Fox, Heiskanen, Hughes, to name a few). With those guys leading the way, the Sabres have many young players who will have plenty of opportunity to improve their game: Dylan Cozens, Owen Power, Jack Quinn, Peyton Krebs, and JJ Peterka will all play significant roles on this team. They are all under 23 years old. Oh, and I forgot! Highly touted goalie prospect Devon Levi will look to be the starter for the Sabres. He went 5-2 in seven starts at the end of last season. He's only 21.</span>
<span id="cb1-279"><a href="#cb1-279" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-280"><a href="#cb1-280" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>But with youth comes inexperience. I want to believe that this is the year they make the playoffs, but there will be little room for error in a very competitive eastern conference. If they string together some losses, will they be able to get back on track? At the very least, they should be a very entertaining watch.</span>

<span id="cb1-289"><a href="#cb1-289" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>I don't know how the feel about the Jets. They just made the playoffs. There seemed to be a rift in the locker room. Head coach Rick Bowness called out his team to the media, and some players had issue with the way the situation was handled. Bowness returns, and his group will look slightly different. Former captain Blake Wheeler is gone. Pierre-Luc Dubois has seemingly wanted out since he got there. He's gone. In return for Dubois, they got some good pieces. Alex Iafallo and Gabriel Vilardi are both capable middle six players. Trade rumors were swirling about both Connor Hellebuyck and Mark Scheifele. They are both UFA's after this season. However, they held on to them both.</span>
<span id="cb1-290"><a href="#cb1-290" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-291"><a href="#cb1-291" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>So, on paper the Jets look like they should be in the mix once again. However, if things go sideways even a little, they could look to sell at the deadline. I'll be curious to see how the handle the trade deadline if they're in a playoff position. Would they hold pat? Or would they go all in to take one stab at it knowing they're likely entering a retool anyway? The Central division has some question marks, so it seems within reason that they could sneak into the three spot.</span>

I thought that before the season, I thought that during the season. I believed this up until the second-last day of the season. Well, I hate to say it Islanders: I'm still not a believer. Maybe it's because every time I watch an Islanders game I have to take a break to watch paint dry, which is far more entertaining. It could be because I just think they're not very good.</span>
<span id="cb1-301"><a href="#cb1-301" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-302"><a href="#cb1-302" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Of course, it helps having arguably a top-2 (top-1?) goalie in the game. Ilya Sorokin will start the season as the favorite for the Vezina Trophy (+400 on DraftKings). He will be unquestionably the teams most important player. Aside from him, this roster is....meh. Their supposed star, Mathew Barzal, hasn't surpassed 62 points since his rookie year (yes, he was on pace a couple years, but let me have my narrative). They insist on playing a fourth line of Matt Martin, Casey Cizikas, and Cal Clutterbuck. Why? The second and third lines don't move me either. </span>

Good defensive structure, great goaltending, and an offense that puts even babies to sleep. They have proven that they can rely on this strategy to make the playoffs and do well. This could very well be the case again this year. However, my guts says a team like the Penguins or Sabres make it in over them. The eastern wild card race should once again be a fun one.</span>

<span id="cb1-313"><a href="#cb1-313" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Speaking of the wild card race in the east, the Ottawa Senators are a team that should be in the hunt. Last season was supposed to be that year, but a season ending injury to Josh Norris early in the season set them back too far. Alex DeBrincat couldn't find his scoring touch and didn't seem happy in Ottawa, so he got shipped to Detroit for Dominik Kubalik and other pieces.</span>
<span id="cb1-314"><a href="#cb1-314" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-315"><a href="#cb1-315" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>However, not all was bad. Tim Stutzle emerged as a star, putting up 90 points in 78 games. Brady Tkachuk had 83. Both these guys are young and should continue their upward trend. On the defensive side, they traded for Jakob Chychrun, giving Thomas Chabot some help. Rookie Jake Sanderson had a quietly great year, putting up 32 points while being good in the defensive zone. At only 21, he has the potential to emerge as another young superstar defenseman. In the offseason, they brought in Vladimir Tarasenko and Joonas Korpisalo.</span>

<span id="cb1-317"><a href="#cb1-317" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The expectations are high for this team. They should be in the hunt for a wild card spot as the year ends.

<span id="cb1-332"><a href="#cb1-332" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>While they won't overwhelm anyone with superstar firepower, the Predators will be an interesting sleeper team to keep an eye. They've got an interesting mix of older skilled players (O'Reilly, Roman Josi, Tyson Barrie, Filip Forsberg) and young/unproven players (Novak, Juuso Parssinen, Philip Tomasino, Luke Evangelista). In my mind, this makes them highly unpredictable. Juuse Saros will almost assuredly be a rock in net. The skaters...who knows? I've mentioned several times I believe the middle of the Central is wide open this season. If it all clicks and the young guys produce, this team could steal a spot. They also might miss by a lot. I really don't know. My prediction: between 60-120 points (bold, I know).</span>

Who on the roster will step up and be just that? Well, there aren't too many options. They're paying Robert Thomas and Jordan Kyrou $8 million apiece. One or both of them need to step up in a big way. Aside from those two, the best options are Pavel Buchnevich and Jakub Vrana. You could argue Binnington is the face of the franchise. He led them to the Cup victory and is always involved in on-ice shenanigans, but his play as of late hasn't warranted "face of the franchise" treatment.</span>

For starters, they all play in the Atlantic division. They've all been on a similar trajectory with their rebuilds. Now, many believe it's time for them to make the playoffs. Unfortunately for them, they'll be fighting each other, as well as the better teams in the Atlantic. Of the three, I'm least bullish about the Red Wings.</span>

Many new names are coming to Hockeytown, but can they help get in the playoffs? If Alex DeBrincat can return to form, he's a great addition to the top six. Klim Kostin and Daniel Sprong are good depth pickups. The most interesting signing was JT Compher. After having increased opportunity in Colorado last year, he put up career highs. I'm not sure I can see him sustaining this. We saw what happened to Nazem Kadri. Compher is a good defender, but if he's going to be the 2C in Detroit, they'll need him to maintain or even increase his production.</span>

Chiarot and Gostisbehere provide very little on the defensive side, and Holl definitely has his struggles on that end too. This seems like a unit that will bleed chances, and can we really expect Ville Husso and James Reimer to save them?</span>

<span id="cb1-392"><a href="#cb1-392" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>It feels as if the Blue Jackets believe they can be a playoff team. Now, on the surface this seems crazy. They finished last year with 59 point, 2nd worst in the league. That fact doesn't exactly indicate *playoff team*. However, I don't think it's a stretch to say they have an outside chance.</span>
<span id="cb1-393"><a href="#cb1-393" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-394"><a href="#cb1-394" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>To start, they didn't have any key departures. That's always a bonus. It's their additions that could make this team a sleeper. To start, their best defender in Zach Werenski only played 13 games last year. His return will improve this team immensely by himself. They'll be bolstering their d-core by adding Damon Severson and Ivan Provorov. Lastly, sucking so bad last year earned them quite the prize. No, they didn't get Connor Bedard. But the Ducks shockingly passed on Adam Fantilli at pick 2 and the Blue Jackets jumped at the opportunity. Fantilli should instantly slot into the top six. The extent of his impact is unknown, but he has a high ceiling. He'll likely be playing alongside other young guys in Kent Johnson and Kirill Marchenko which will make for a fun watch.</span>

Just two seasons ago he put up a whopping 115 points. He is 30 years old which begs the question, can he bounce back? I don't see him touching 115 again, but I believe 100 is within reach. Ultimately, the Blue Jackets are in position to have a much better season, but how much better will it be?</span>

<span id="cb1-418"><a href="#cb1-418" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The Canadiens' run to the Stanley Cup Final in 2021 was truly special. IN a normal year, they probably don't even make the playoffs. However, they were in a weak Northern division. They took advantage. Props to them. The years since haven't been so kind. After making the Final, they fell to the bottom of te league, picking first overall in 2022. Last season, they picked 5th. It would seem as if they'll be picking high again this year.</span>
<span id="cb1-419"><a href="#cb1-419" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-420"><a href="#cb1-420" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>While the roster isn't great, they do have a lot of young players. Nick Suzuki and Cole Caufield are the "franchise" guys. they are very good players with a lot of room to grow. With the first pick in 2022, they took Juraj Slafkovsky. He was a bit underwhelming in 39 games last year but he has potential. Remember, not all first overall picks breakout in year one. They traded for Alex Newhook who has shown flashes of talent but hasn't been able to put together consistency yet. Keep an eye out for Raphael Harvey-Pinard who looked very good in 34 games last season.</span>

<span id="cb1-422"><a href="#cb1-422" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>So, they won't be making a push for the playoffs, but there's reason to believe they will be better this season.</span>

<span id="cb1-431"><a href="#cb1-431" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Expectations are a tough thing to manage. Connor Bedard has received well deserved hype. But is there any way he can actually live up to these lofty expectations in year one? Let's take a look at what some other notable rookies have done. Connor McDavid put up 48 points in an injury-shortened season. Sidney Crosby had 102 points in 81 games during his rookie year. Auston Matthews put up 40 goals in his. If he starts his career anything like those guys, 100 points is well within reach.</span>
<span id="cb1-432"><a href="#cb1-432" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-433"><a href="#cb1-433" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Let's be optimistic and say Bedard will be everything we expect him to be. How much can he alone carry this team? The truth is, the Blackhawks' roster is still a heaping pile of garbage. I don't know how else to put it. For some reason, instead of trying to surround Bedard with young talent, they brought in a bunch of washed veterans. I know it was a weak free agency class, but this the best we could do? Truly baffling. They'll likely be near the bottom of the standings, with a chance to get 1st overall in back to back years.</span>
